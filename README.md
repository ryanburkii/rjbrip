# Ryan Berke - Personal Portfolio

This is my personal website, built with Next.js. It is a work in progress that was inspired by [Posthog's website](https://posthog.com/), however my website is nowhere near Posthog's level of functionality.

## Design Features

- **OS-Inspired Interface** with a menu bar, window management, and familiar OS interactions
- **Window System** that allows for fully draggable and resizable windows
- **Interactive Navigation** via a menu bar with quick access to different sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
